 Auxiliary logins are identities that can be used to allow other people to login to the same account but with  Equal or less privileges than that is normally possible. It will also help you to keep track of who exactly was logged in a particular point to the system. In the <url:a=list&c=actionlog> action logs </url>,  session listing  and the  [b] login history [/b]  list, there is now an extra field called as [b] auxiliary id [/b].

 For high security, you can also disable the admin account, create an auxiliary id with full permissions and use that for logging into the system.

 Please note that the person, after supplying the correct auxiliary credentials is actually logged in as the real login itself, and at this point, there could be security issues. So you should only give auxiliary logins to trusted people--typically your own staff.
