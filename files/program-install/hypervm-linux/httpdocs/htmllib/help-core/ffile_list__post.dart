Please NOTE: The graph on the left of each file, seen after you have clicked on the [b] disk usage [/b], shows the usage of that file relative to the total. When the tag on the graph says "file [b] a.tar.gz [/b]  uses 10MB of 30MB", it means that the total size occupied by the all the files in the directory is 30MB, and [b] a.tar.gz [/b]  uses 10MB. This is in no way related to your total disk quota. The graph merely shows the size of one file in relation to the total used by all the files in that particular directory.


Normally, the actual disk space occupied by the directories is not shown. Click on [b] disk space [/b]  so that instead of showing the '0' or '4096' against the directory size, the listing will show the actual space occupied by the directories. Please note that this is a resource intensive process, and will take a bit of time. Also, this is a one time operation. If you want to see the disk usages again, you have to click on [b]disk space [/b] again. 

 You can sort by [b] real size [/b] by clicking on the size and then clicking on [b] disk space [/b]
