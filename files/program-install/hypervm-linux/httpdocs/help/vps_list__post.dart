 By default, the listing will only show values that are stored in the database, and will not get the live status. You can get the live status by clicking on [b] hardrefresh [/b], which will collect all the information, including the status from all the servers. Also, you can move the mouse over certain values and get more information about them. For instance, moving the mouse over the server will show complete and detailed information about that particular server.
